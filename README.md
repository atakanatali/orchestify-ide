# 🦊 Orchestify IDE

**The AI Agent Orchestration IDE**

![Orchestify Logo](resources/linux/orchestify.png)

## Vision

Orchestify transforms your development workflow by allowing you to orchestrate multiple AI "Junior Developer" agents. Like a conductor leading an orchestra, you direct specialized agents to handle frontend, backend, testing, and documentation tasks simultaneously.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Run multiple AI agents in parallel with distinct roles
- **Real-Time Streaming** - Watch agent thoughts, code changes, and terminal output live
- **Conductor Mode** - Pause, edit, and resume agent workflows with your "baton"
- **Fox Dashboard** - Visualize active agents and their current tasks
- **Local RAG** - Agents understand your entire codebase through intelligent indexing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for local LLM inference

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antigravity/orchestify.git
cd orchestify

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development build
npm run watch

# In a new terminal, launch the IDE
./scripts/code.sh
```

## Design Philosophy

Orchestify features a unique visual identity:
- **Deep Burgundy** (#2A0A0A) base theme
- **Sunset Orange** (#FF8C00) primary accents
- **Cyan Glow** for active agent states
- **Glassmorphism** UI components
